            <strong>These are my favourite places to visit when you are on your vacation</strong>
            <p><strong>Scotland</strong> is one of my favourite tourism place, if does not matter if you are in Edimburgh or in highlands, everything is amazing there</p>
            <p><strong>Switzerland</strong> is the other great place to visit when you have time and money, I like to hike mountains, ride my bike everywhere and see how special are lakes there</p>
